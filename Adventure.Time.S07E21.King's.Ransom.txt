Ice King: All right! Where is he?!
Finn: Ice King?!
Ice king: Where is he?!
Finn: Jake? He's right there.
Jake: Man, Ice King, you better roll on.
Ice King: Where are you hiding him?!
Finn: Who are you talking about?
Ice King: It's Gunter! He's gone missing!
[Thunder]
Ice King: You in there, Goontz?
Finn: Ice King, we didn't take Gunter.
Jake: Come on, man, not the food.
Ice King: Daddy's here to save you, Goonty!
Finn: What makes you think we took him?
Ice King: 'Cause it's obvious You took Gunter, because Gunter is like your Jake.
Finn: Wait, what?
Ice King: Or maybe Gunter's like your Finn. The point is, you guys have always resented us for that fact, and that right there constitutes motive And conspiracy to harm my little road dog, Gunter!
Finn: Hey, Jake, do you think you could, like, turn into a little Gunter and go over to him?
Jake: That's gonna be kind of weird.
Finn: Yeah, but it'll calm him down, so
Jake: All right, all right, all right. Wenk, wenk.
Ice King: Aww, look at the little guy.
Finn: You want to try telling us what happened?
Ice King: Okay, so, we were watching some young men's junior figure skating championships on the tube semi-finals. I went to the kitchen to fix us up something to eat. When I came back, he was gone.
Finn: What do you think, Jake? Should we check out the ice kingdom for clues?
Jake: Or we could get a real good night's sleep and start fresh and early in the morning. Wenk, wenk.
