[Scene begins with Finn, Neptr, Flame Princess, Crab Princess, Crab King and assorted others standing around a bonfire in front of a buffet with two flags saying "clam" and "rap".]
Neptr: [Rapping] C-C-C-C-Clam Rap. Juicy like nectar, my name is NEPTR, I stay rapping no matter what the weather. I'm by the fire 'cause it's hot like a dryer. [Continues indistinctly]
Finn: [To Flame Princess] Clams and rappin'. Doesn't get any better than this, right Phoebe?
Flame Princess: It's actually my first Clam Rap.
Finn: [Beatboxing] [Rapping] Clams, clams, ate this plate of clams. Utensils weren't provided so I had to use my hands. I'm gonna be unhappy if it happens agains. Boom!
[Audience cheers]
Finn: Princess, what you got?
Neptr: Yeah, dump it in, stir it up!
Flame Princess: [Rapping] I'm like a library book, so check me out, read my front and back cover so you know what I'm about. I'm straight droolin', spittin' out rhymes. People gather round and they're waitin' in lines. I got a lot of combinations of words to throw to let you know I got glow. I said it 'cause you just don't know. So what now? What's up, what's up bro?
[Cheers and applause from everyone, including Finn.]
Finn: You beat me fair and square, 'cause maybe something's in the air. I'm wearing unlucky shoes, not my favorite pair.
[Audience groans and walks away][Indistinct conversation]
Toronto: [Wearing a false mustache][To Flame Princess] Hello there young lady. I heard you lay down some serious rhymes earlier. [Eats a clam, then throws the shell away over one shoulder] My card. [Hands Flame Princess a small business card]
[Flame Princess holds up the business card, which reads "VICTOR MARILYN, TALENT BOOKER"]
Flame Princess: [Reading the card] Victor Marilyn? [The card catches fire and burns to ash in her hands]
