[Princess Bubblegum, Marceline, Finn, and Jake are following the trail of glowing orbs left by The Moon. Princess Bubblegum is using a Geiger counter-like device and getting feedback.]
Princess Bubblegum: Mm-hmm. Six and 19...
Finn: One vampire—[stomps on orb and blows a raspberry], two vampire—[stomps on orb and blows a raspberry]. Jake, check me out—I'm a self-sufficient mountain man. [eats orb]
Jake: No! [slaps orb out of Finn's mouth] Don't put that biz in your mouth, man! They could be booby-trapped or poisoned or—
Marceline: Whoa, chill, Jake. These pearls were dropped by The Moon. Her main power is accelerated healing. It'll be like fighting a cutting board.
Jake: Hmm. Okay. Anyways, we should try to find her before—[Finn pushes a pearl against Jake's cheek] No! [pushes it away]
[He and Finn tussle, shoving the pearl into each other's face.]
Marceline: [laughs]
Princess Bubblegum: See, Marcy? Isn't vampire hunting better with friends?
Marceline: Yeah, I guess. I'm just glad Simon is okay.
Jake: Anyway... [dusts himself off] I don't care how easy this vamp's supposed to be. We should hole up somewhere before the sun goes down—It's down. Great.
Princess Bubblegum: Yup. Let's get going. [uses Geiger counter] My vampire thingy is indicating high levels of vampire junk in... [points] this direction. Come on!
[The gang follows Princess Bubblegum's lead. A nearby bush rustles and Crunchy emerges, out of breath. He gasps as King of Ooo, riding a horse and wielding a bow and arrow, jumps out of the bush after him and knocks him on his backside.]
King of Ooo: Ha-ha!
Crunchy: Stop, please!
King of Ooo: Don't be such a nerd, Crunchy. [draws back cotton-tipped arrow] Hunting is the most royal of sports. The people expect it of their princess-king.
Crunchy: I don't think that's tr— [arrow hits him] Ow! [runs away] Aah!
King of Ooo: [clicks tongue] After him, Haydancy!
King of Ooo: Come on, Crunchy, it's dark. Let me tie you up.
King of Ooo: Aha! Good growling, Crunchy.
King of Ooo: All right, that's a bit much.
King of Ooo: Whoa, girl! Oof! Ugh!
Crunchy: Oh, no stop! Shush up! Huh? Oh!
Crunchy: It's it's okay. Animals can't climb trees. That's what separates us from them.
King of Ooo: Ha! Dumb, lowly animals.

Hierophant: Marceline Where is she?
King of Ooo: Oh, boy! I-I wish I knew! No love lost there, am I right?

Hierophant: I'm a vampire! Drinking blood is kind of the main thing.
Marceline: And you can drink red just as easy.
Hierophant: Hmm.
Marceline: No hurting poor, scared, blood-filled animals.
Hierophant: Well, then, I suppose I have no choice. I'm just going to waste you And eat that kid, because that's what an old-school vampire does!
Crunchy: I don't want to play anymore!
Hierophant: No! I wasn't invited! No!
Finn: Geez. What happened?
Marceline: Dude was too old fashioned for his own good. He just couldn't get with the times.
Crunchy: Y'all see that? I killed a vampire.
