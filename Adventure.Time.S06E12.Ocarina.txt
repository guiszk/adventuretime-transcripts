[Newborn birds are chirping in their nest as the father bird reads a newspaper with his back turned. The babies fall out. The camera pans down the tree past banners saying "HAPPY BIRTHDAY," "CHARLIE," "VIOLA," "JAKE JR.," "T.V.," and "KIM KIL WHAN." At the base of the tree is T.V., typing on his laptop, with the baby birds on his head.]
T.V.: Ugh. I'm covered in noobs.
[T.V. shakes the birds off his head, closes his laptop, and walks back to his family.]
Lady Rainicorn: T.V., 잘 지내니? (How are you?)
T.V.: [groans] I've got hunger cranks.
Viola: Hmm? Oh, yes. That's very [bats Charlie's hair] interesting.
T.V.: Kim Kil Whan. [steps over him]
Kim Kil Whan: Hm.
[T.V. sits on a blanket by Jake Jr., who is playing her guitar. He opens his laptop and continues typing.]
T.V.: Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraahh! [closes laptop] Mom, when are we gonna eat?! I'm going nuts!
Lady Rainicorn: T.V., 말조심해! (Watch your mouth!)
Jake Jr.: Seriously, Mom, Dad's already three hours late with the food!
Viola: You hush, Junior. You know Dad's a wonderful cook.
Jake Jr.: Viola, when's the last time you even heard from Dad?
Viola: Oh, you know. Dad is... distractible.
Jake Jr.: [laughs] "Distractible"!
T.V.: Yeah, I love Dad and everything, but he's only ever met me twice.
Lady Rainicorn: Charlie, Viola, T.V., Jake Jr., Kim Kil Whan, 제발! 너네 아빠가 너를 얼마나 보고 싶어하는데. (Please! Your dad really wants to see you.) [gasps]
[She looks up to see Finn and Jake falling from the sky. Jake crash lands, gouging a trail in the grass.]
Finn & Jake: [laugh] Whoo!
Finn: Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Jake: Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out there—I didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch! [takes out a wad of macaroni and sets it on the ground] It's macaroni salad.
Viola: Dad, you're beautiful!
Kim Kil Whan: Dad! We have new business to discuss.
Jake: Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan.
Kim Kil Whan: Birthdays are old business. [teleports Jake next to him]
Jake: Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things going, Son?
Kim Kil Whan: "Things"? "Things" have switched hands.
Jake: Heh. [gives thumbs up] I get it.
Kim Kil Whan: Dad, when I say that things have switched hands, I mean to say that things you have previously claimed ownership of have transferred from your hands to my hands, in that... [conjures a briefcase containing a deed] I bought your tree house.
Jake: What?!
Kim Kil Whan: What: the deed to your tree house. How: acquired through legal trade. From whom: the deed's previous owner, Marceline The Vampire Queen... [conjures Marceline] in exchange for one lunatic bass.
[Marceline plays her new four-necked bass and disappears.]
Kim Kil Whan: When: effective immediately.
Jake: But, Son, why?
Kim Kil Whan: We will convene at the property.
[Kim Kil Whan uses his powers to teleport Finn and Jake to the Tree Fort. On the door is a sign: "SUITES FOR RENT. INQUIRE OUTWARDLY." Jake reads the sign and makes a worried groan.]
Kim Kil Whan: [Teleports next to Finn and Jake, brushing dirt off his sleeve.] Sorry I'm late. Okay, so, as the deed-holder of this tree house I am now your landlord. [Pulls out cellphone from suit pocket and flips it open.] The first thing I'm going to have to do is assess your treasure room. [Closes cellphone and puts it back in pocket.]
Jake: [Gets down on one knee in front of Kim Kil Whan.] But son! [Crawls to Kim Kil Whan.] What would your mother say? Doing this to your poor Pip-Pop!
Kim Kil Whan: I'm sorry Dad. Deeds don't bleed. [Pushes away Jake, who rolls over.]
Jake: [Opens front door of Tree Fort.] Okay son. Get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu--Oh, yeah. We spent all of it. [Finn and Kim Kil Whan follow Jake into the Tree Fort. Jake walks over to two black and white polaroids lying on the floor and picks them up.] All we have left are these vintage photos I got at the flea market. They're interesting!
Kim Kil Whan: Woof. [He takes the photos and puts them in his suit pocket.] All right. [He gestures to the ladder leading to the second floor of the Tree Fort.] So I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder.
Kim Kil Whan: [Cellphone rings, he answers it.] Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over. [Hangs up and puts cellphone away.] Sorry about that. [Clears throat.] Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first and second floor access. Superb craftsmanship and etcetera. I suppose you're familiar. [Finn raises his hand.] Yes, Finn?
Finn: Yeah, uh, when are we going to get our house back?
Kim Kil Whan: [Frowning] What? [Someone knocks on the front door.] Excuse me.
Kim Kil Whan: [Walks to the door and opens it.] Good afternoon! Yes, right this way. [An assortment of characters walk into the Tree Fort] I've got 37 available units to show in this building so we're going to want to get right to it. Please step inside. [Kim Kil Whan shuts the door. Finn and Jake are now surrounded by a crowd of creatures.] There you go. Is that everyone? Good, good. Please make your way upstairs and we'll begin the tour. [Everyone except Finn and Jake walk up to the second floor. Kim Kil Whan approaches Finn and Jake.] And you two make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the first, no overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the TP, and then once more in the middle of using the TP if you're going to use a lot. It's easier on the pipes. Okay. Call me if you need me. [Kim Kil Whan floats to the second floor.]
Finn: [Night falls. Finn and Jake sit on the ladder while the other tenants go about their evening routines nearby. Finn groans in frustration and then sighs.]
Jake: Hey Finn. I'm real sorry about this. Somehow I feel like it's kinda my fault.
Finn: Nah man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight. [Finn tries to get into a comfortable position on the ladder.]
Jake: You're gonna sleep... like that?
Finn: Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.
Jake: [Sighs and shrinks down so he fits onto the ladder rung easily.] I promise, I'll work this thi--Aaah! [A strange creature steps on Jake and then Finn as it walks up the ladder.]
Creature: Gee but it's great to be back home, eh Mr. B? [He steps on Finn's face, leaving a shoe print mark.]
Mr. B: Haha, yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt. [He drags his butt across Finn's face as he walks up the ladder.]
Finn: [Stands up, making disgusted noises. He walks upstairs to the bathroom, passing sleeping tenants whose "apartments" are marked out by lines of chalk. He washes the shoe print off his face.]
Goblin: [Crouched by the toilet in fear, a cellphone held to his ear] Oh, oh holy cow. Oh, oh boy, please hurry. Yes, he's inside my apartment right now! Oh, I'm so scared!
Jake: [Offscren] Hey buddy, you okay?
Goblin: Glob, now there's two of 'em!
Jake: [Standing in the bathroom] I just feel if we're patient this whole thing will work itself out before you know it. [Sirens wail in the distance, their lights flashing through the bathroom window.] Haha! See, man? Help is on the way!
[Scene shifts to the police station. Finn and Jake are handcuffed and sitting on a bench.]
Finn:  Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on here. I mean like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's OUR house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested?! This is crazy! It's crazy!! [A Banana Guard walking by looks over at Finn and Jake, surprised by the outburst, then moves on.]
Jake: Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us.
Finn: They're not?!
Jake: Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, "The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, "This is fair now, this is the law." Once they were winning, they changed the rules up.
Finn: Woah, just like Kim Kil Whan!
Banana Guard: Hey, good news, fellas. [Unlocks Finn and Jake's handcuffs.] Your bail's paid. You're free to go.
Jake: Haha, that's awesome!
Finn: Yeah, awesome!
Kim Kil Whan: Yeah. Real "awesome."
Jake: Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw buddy, I knew you'd come around! [Jumps up and hugs Kim Kil Whan, hanging onto his body.] Haha, fathers and sons, man. That's that REAL thick chowder. [Jake chuckles. Kim Kil Whan hands him a note from his notepad.] What's this?
Kim Kil Whan: This is a bill for the bail I just paid.
Jake: [In shock at the amount.] Ooh. [Jake slides down Kim Kil Whan and plops on the floor.]
Kim Kil Whan: You're really in it deep here, Dad. It's time for you to get real, get a job. No more games.
Jake: Come on, son! Just let me do the-- [Kim Kil Whan teleports away before Jake can finish speaking. Jake fades off into gibberish.]
[The scene changes to Finn and Jake walking through the Candy Forest away from the Candy Kingdom]
Jake: [Sighs.] Man, where did I go wrong?
Finn: I don't know. But I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later.
Jake: [Finn and Jake stop walking.] Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'?
Finn: Well, actually...I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right. [Finn shrugs.] Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.
Jake: Oh yeah.... Yeah. Oh no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!
Finn: Yuss!!
Kim Kil Whan: [Scene changes to the tree house, where Kim Kil Whan stands in Finn and Jake's bedroom, talking to a creature sitting on Finn's bed.] Oh yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an additional deposit. [A dog pops out from the creature and barks.] Excellent.
Finn: [The sound of Finn laughing can be heard suddenly. Kim Kil Whan looks out the window to see Jake digging a big hole in the front yard, splattering dirt on Finn.] Watch it!
Kim Kil Whan: [Turns back to the creature.] Excuse me. [He teleports away.]
