[In the Tree Fort's bathroom, BMO is standing on a stool in front of the mirror and talking to Football.]
BMO: Football, you don't mean that.
Football: I do, BMO. I don't say things I don't mean. You look very smart and very handsome today.
BMO: [blushing] Oh, Football, thank you. I love you so much.
Football: I love you, BMO.
BMO: Ring, ring. [makes phone with hand] Hello? Football? This is BMO.
Football: Oh, hello, BMO. What a wonderful surprise. What's up?
BMO: Oh, nothing. Just wanted to say that I love you.
Football: I love you, too. Goodbye. Click.
BMO: Can I tell you a secret?
Football: Of course, BMO. You can tell me anything.
BMO: I love you.
Football: Oh. [giggles]
BMO: Now you tell me a secret, Football.
Football: I wish I could spend just one day on the other side of the mirror.
BMO: Well, let's switch places for the day.
Football: Oh, BMO, you'd do that for me?
BMO: Yes, Football. Because I love you.
Football: Oh, BMO.
[BMO pushes against the mirror.]
BMO: [grunts]
Football: [straining]
[The stool starts rocking, then stops. BMO and Football stop pushing.]
Football: Oh! [panting] Oh! [laughs]
BMO: [in mirror] See you back here tomorrow, Football. [waves]
